The JSON structure is hierarchical and includes nested fields for video IDs, thumbnails, and statistics such as views and likes. YouTube’s backend likely uses BigQuery and other Google Cloud services to store and manage data. The API fetches this data in JSON format, commonly consumed by frontend JavaScript frameworks.\nUsing XML W3Schools: W3Schools offers XML data examples, including a sample file that provides information on books. The XML structure uses descriptive tags such as , , and . The data can be accessed using XML parsers in JavaScript or server-side languages. Technologies like DOM and XSLT are used to query or transform the XML structure for web display.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\n\nSELECT student.ID\nFROM student\nLEFT JOIN advisor ON student.ID = advisor.s_ID\nWHERE advisor.i_ID IS NULL;\n\n\n\nSELECT I.ID, I.name\nFROM instructor I\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (\n  SELECT *\n  FROM course C\n  WHERE C.dept_name = I.dept_name\n    AND NOT EXISTS (\n      SELECT *\n      FROM teaches T\n      WHERE T.ID = I.ID AND T.course_id = C.course_id\n    )\n)\nORDER BY I.name;\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\n\n\n   id     name              dept_name      salary\n1  63395  McKinnon          Cybernetics    94333.99\n2  78699  Pingr             Statistics     59303.62\n3  96895  Mird              Marketing      119921.41\n4  4233   Luo               English        88791.45\n5  4034   Murata            Athletics      61387.56\n6  50885  Konstantinides    Languages      32570.50\n\n\n\n   id     name              dept_name      salary\n1  63395  McKinnon          Cybernetics    94333.99\n2  78699  Pingr             Statistics     59303.62\n3  96895  Mird              Marketing      119921.41\n4  4233   Luo               English        88791.45\n5  4034   Murata            Athletics      61387.56\n6  50885  Konstantinides    Languages      32570.50\n\n\n\n    id       name           dept_name       tot_cred\n1   79352    Rumat          Finance          100\n2   76672    Miliko         Statistics       116\n3   14182    Moszkowski     Civil Eng.       73\n4   44985    Prieto         Biology          91\n5   44271    Sowerby        English          108\n6   40897    Coppens        Math             58\n\n\n\n   id       name           dept_name        salary\n1  63395    McKinnon       Cybernetics      94333.99\n2  78699    Pingr          Statistics       59303.62\n3  96895    Mird           Marketing        119921.41\n4  4233     Luo            English          88791.45\n5  4034     Murata         Athletics        61387.56\n6  50885    Konstantinides Languages        32570.50\n7  79653    Levine         Elec.

    "text": "Question 1: E-R Diagram as a Graph\nAn E-R (Entity-Relationship) diagram can be viewed as a graph, where entities are nodes and relationships are edges. Understanding its structure helps ensure database integrity and effective design.\n\n\na) The graph is disconnected\nA disconnected graph means that some parts of the schema are isolated and do not connect to others. In terms of an enterprise schema, this implies that certain entities or relationships are not integrated with the rest of the database system.\nExample: Imagine we have a Doctor entity and a Patient entity, but no relationship (like Treats) connecting them. These two entities are disconnected in the E-R diagram.\nImplications: - Indicates missing relationships or a design flaw. - Can result in incomplete or difficult-to-query data. - Hurts the ability to enforce referential integrity.\n\n\nb) The graph has a cycle\nA cycle in an E-R diagram means that starting from one entity, you can follow a path of relationships and return to the same entity.\nExample: Doctor → Patient → Test → Doctor\nThis forms a loop (cycle) in the schema.\nImplications: - Not inherently wrong – cycles often represent real-world interconnectedness. - Can complicate queries, especially recursive ones. - May require careful normalization or handling to avoid data anomalies.\n\n\nQuestion 3: Why Do We Have Weak Entity Sets?\nWhile it’s possible to convert weak entity sets to strong ones by adding attributes, we still use weak entity sets in practice due to design clarity and efficiency.\nReasons We Use Weak Entity Sets:\n\nA weak entity cannot be uniquely identified by its own attributes.\nIt depends on a related strong entity for uniqueness.\n\nWhy Not Always Use Strong Entities?\n\nMaking weak entities strong can require adding redundant or artificial keys, which is not always natural.\nWeak entities simplify data modeling for real-world hierarchical relationships.\nHelps maintain referential integrity and logical clarity in the schema.\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\na: SQL Queries\nSchema:\nemployee(ID, name, street, city)\nworks(ID, company_id, salary)\ncompany(company_id, name, city)\nmanages(employee_id, manager_id)\n\nFind ID and name of employees who live in the same city as the location of their company:\n\nSELECT e.ID, e.name\nFROM employee AS e, works AS w, company AS c\nWHERE e.ID = w.ID AND w.company_id = c.company_id AND e.city = c.city;\n\nFind ID and name of employees who live on the same street and in the same city as their manager:\n\nSELECT e.ID, e.name\nFROM employee AS e, manages AS m, employee AS mngr\nWHERE e.ID = m.employee_id AND m.manager_id = mngr.ID\nAND e.city = mngr.city AND e.street = mngr.street;\n\nFind ID and name of employees who earn more than the average salary of all employees in their company:\n\nSELECT e.ID, e.name\nFROM employee AS e, works AS w\nWHERE e.ID = w.ID AND w.salary &gt; ( SELECT AVG(w2.salary)\nFROM works AS w2\nWHERE w2.company_id = w.company_id\n\n\nb: What’s wrong with this SQL query?\nSELECT name, title\nFROM instructor NATURAL JOIN teaches NATURAL JOIN section NATURAL JOIN course\nWHERE semester = ‘Spring’ AND year = 2017;\nProblem: This query uses NATURAL JOIN, which joins tables based on all columns with the same name. This can cause unintended matches, especially if tables have generic column names like ID or course_id.\nFix: Use explicit JOINs to clearly specify matching fields.\nCorrected Query:\nSELECT i.name, c.title\nFROM instructor AS i\nJOIN teaches AS t ON i.ID = t.ID\nJOIN section AS s ON t.course_id = s.course_id\nAND t.sec_id = s.sec_id\nAND t.semester = s.semester\nAND t.year = s.year JOIN course AS c ON s.course_id = c.course_id\nWHERE s.semester = ‘Spring’ AND s.year = 2017;"
